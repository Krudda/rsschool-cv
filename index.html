                        <p> 
                                I am interested in the opportunity to change the direction of professional activity, and I
                                would like to get a job as a junior front-end developer.
                                To gain knowledge, I graduated from six-month offline continuing education courses
                                at Lobachevsky University (Nizhny Novgorod), specializing in web development.
                                The training involved HTML, CSS, PHP, JS. In addition, I attended offline courses
                                on React from the Nizhny Novgorod IT-company Lad. I'm learning JS and ReactNativ myself. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                My professional competencies include a lot of fintech experience: 
                                <ul>
                                        <li>building an architecture for organizing electronic payments, interacting with banks.</li>
                                        <li>I know the internal processes of Russian credit organizations, the principles of operation
                                                of international payment systems and the instant payment system of the Central Bank of Russia (SBP). </li>
                                        <li>I am familiar with the relevant legislation governing banking and accepting payments, as well as
                                                with the regulatory framework of the Bank Of Russia.</li>
                                        <li>In addition, I devoted a lot of time to building relationships with banks and recipients of funds.</li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Among my personal qualities, I can note the ability to compromise in business negotiations, maintain calm in stressful working situations, quickly understand complex issues, and lead a team.
                                I love and know how to get knowledge.
